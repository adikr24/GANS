Generalized Neural Networks or GANS

Gans are an upcoming algorithm in machine learning where a different approach of training can be seen. An adversary is used in training this model which is analogous to 
police and theif example where if one tries to improve themself the other nudge their game to keep up. Hence with this mindset I have followed along some code and 
sample problems and wanted to code my own gans

### Data preparation
Data was downloaded from pytorch datasets and Generator was trained only on 32 images from one batch
the code starts by importing packages and then dives into model architecture where it creates a convolution network so that discriminator can be trained on real as well
as fake data

### a normal distribution with same batch size and a user def number is used to create z(image distribution). Image z when plotted can be seen to not make any sense
as it's just a collection of random pixels but the idea behind this algorithm is to train the generator which takes in z and outputs some X(image) to fool discriminator into
thinking that this image is original, Original Image is also fed into discriminator simultaneously. After training the model for few epochs it can be seen that 
generator is producing some commendable images which closely resemble the original images.


##### in my later codes i'll try to implement this idea into audio data to see if I can generate some new accents and can try and teach the computer to recognize every 
possible accent there is.
